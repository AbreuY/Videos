Videos
======================

An app lists all the videos from the sdcard (except for the ones not recorded to the system db.),
where you can perform such ops as topping, deleting and playing.

## Features
- Videos are listed and classified by each item for the videos under the same directory or just
  a standalone file.
- Top a recently viewed or favourite video directory or video from the list.
- Delete all the videos within a directory or a single video file.
- Rename a video file or make an alias for a video directory.
- Share a video file to another app.
- View the details of a video file/directory.
- Search the videos matching all of the search key words.
- Play a video from the app list or across from an other app (such as a file manager/explorer).
  Audio files are also permitted in the latter case.
- A set of useful, typical, and even awesome ops for the audio/video playbacks.

## Developing Videos

#### Project branches
- Development work happens on the `dev` branch. Pull requests should normally be made to this branch.
- The `release` branch holds the most recent release.
- The `beta` branch contains all the versions published, including tests.
- The `lite` branch is the same as the `beta` one but without the side drawer for the application homepage.

#### Using Android Studio
To develop Videos using Android Studio, simply open the Videos project in the root directory of the repository.
